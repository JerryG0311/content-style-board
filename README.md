# Content Style Board

Content Style Board is a local web app that automatically finds high-performing social media posts and displays them as visual, draggable thumbnails on a whiteboard, grouped by content style.

## Why This Exists

Finding inspiration for social content is slow and manual. This tool removes the need to hunt through profiles by automatically surfacing posts that match specific content styles.

## Features (MVP)

- Style-based search (e.g. multi-clip reels, carousels, threads)
- Automatic discovery via web search
- Visual link previews (thumbnails, not favicons)
- Draggable whiteboard-style layout
- AI-assisted content style tagging

## Tech Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- Brave Search API
- Google Gemini API
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS

## Running Locally (coming soon)
